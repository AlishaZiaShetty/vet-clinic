# Vet Clinic Tutorial Project

This project is used as the basis of a number of tutorials and exercises, as part of the *Professional Java Development and Test Automation Skills* program (see http://johnfergusonsmart.com/products). Each tutorial explores a different technique or practice essential to modern Java developers or Engineers in Test. 

These tutorials are designed to be used as the basis of small coding exercises (similar to very short coding katas) that you can learn and practice until you are familiar with a particular technique. The approach is outlined here:

![Learning from the tutorials](src/documentation/images/tutorial-process.png)

1. Clone this repository and check out the starting point for the tutorial you want to do.
2. Watch the tutorial and follow along on your own machine.
3. Redo the tutorial following the step-by-step instructions given in the tutorial's README file.
4. Redo the exercise without the instructions.

## Starting a tutorial

Each tutorial has two main branches, one for the starting point for the tutorial, and one for a sample solution. The format for the branch names uses a simple naming convention to identify the starting point and the sample solutions for each tutorial. For example, to start tutorial 1, check out the `start` branch like this:
```
$ git checkout tutorial-1/start
```

And to see the solution for tutorial 1, use the solution branch:
```
$ git checkout tutorial-1/solution
```

Go to the tutorial branch to see the step-by-step instructions for that tutorial.
